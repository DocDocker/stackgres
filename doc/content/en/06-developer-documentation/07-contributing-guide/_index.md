StackGres is open source, and as such we welcome any external contribution, in the form of feedback, testing, resources,
 documentation and, of course, code. Pull requests are always welcome.

Please observe the following rules when contributing to StackGres:

* [Create an issue](https://gitlab.com/ongresinc/stackgres/issues/new) with any question or improvements about the source
 code, to keep the discussion organized.

* Contact us at stackgres at ongres dot com before sending a pull request, to have a contributor agreement signed with us.
 This is a requirement for your pull request to be merged upstream.

* Changes and pull requests should be performed from the development branch, instead of master. Please adhere as much
 as possible to the apparent style of the code you are editing.
