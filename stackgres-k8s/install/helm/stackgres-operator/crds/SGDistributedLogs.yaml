                The name of the StackGres cluster to be created. Following
                [Kubernetes naming conventions](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/architecture/identifiers.md),
                it must be an rfc1035/rfc1123 subdomain, that is, up to 253 characters consisting of one or more
                lowercase labels separated by `.`. Where each label is an alphanumeric (a-z, and 0-9) string, with a
                maximum length of 63 characters, with the `-` character allowed anywhere except the first or last
                character.

                This name needs to be unique across all StackGres clusters in the same namespace. The full cluster name
                will include the namespace in which the cluster will be created.

                    Size of the PersistentVolume to be created for the pod of the cluster for distributed logs.
                    Size must be specified either in Mebibytes, Gibibytes or Tebibytes (multiples of 2^20, 2^30
                     or 2^40, respectively).

                    It is a best practice, on non-containerized environments, when running production workloads, to
                    run each database server on a different server (virtual or physical), i.e., not to co-locate more
                    than one database server per host.

                    The same best practice applies to databases on containers. By default, StackGres will not allow to
                    run more than one StackGres pod on a given K8s node. Set this property to true to allow more than
                    one StackGres pod per node.
