  "metadata.name": "The name of this Postgres Configuration. This Postgres configuration may be referenced by zero or more SGClusters, and if so it would be referenced by this name. Following [Kubernetes naming conventions](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/architecture/identifiers.md), it must be an rfc1035/rfc1123 subdomain, that is, up to 253 characters consisting of one or more lowercase labels separated by `.`. Where each label is an alphanumeric (a-z, and 0-9) string, with a maximum length of 63 characters, with the `-` character allowed anywhere except the first or last character.\n\nThis name needs to be unique across all Postgres configurations in the same namespace.\n",
  "spec.postgresVersion": "The **major** Postgres version this configuration is for. Postgres major versions contain one number starting with version 10 (`10`, `11`, `12`, etc), and two numbers separated by a dot for previous versions (`9.6`, `9.5`, etc).\n\nNote that Postgres maintains full compatibility across minor versions, and hence a configuration for a given major version will work for any minor version of that same major version.\n\nCheck [StackGres component versions](https://stackgres.io/doc/latest/01-introduction/06-versions/) to see the Postgres versions supported by this version of StackGres.\n",
  "spec.postgresql.conf": "The `postgresql.conf` parameters that this configuration contains. They are represented as an object, where the keys are valid names for the `postgresql.conf` configuration file parameters of the given `postgresVersion`. You may check [postgresqlco.nf](https://postgresqlco.nf) as a reference on how to tune and find the valid parameters for a given major version.\n"
