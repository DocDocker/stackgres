    "metadata.name": "The name of this Backup Configuration. StackGres supports\n[Continuous Archiving](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/continuous-archiving.html)-based backups,\nwhich help achieve near-zero data loss in case of recovery from a backup. And they will be performed\nautomatically. An SGBackupConfig contains the necessary configuration for automatic backups, and this\nfield is the name of the given configuration, that may be referenced by zero or more\nSGClusters, and if so it would be referenced by this name. Following\n[Kubernetes naming conventions](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/architecture/identifiers.md),\nit must be an rfc1035/rfc1123 subdomain, that is, up to 253 characters consisting of one or more\nlowercase labels separated by `.`. Where each label is an alphanumeric (a-z, and 0-9) string, with a\nmaximum length of 63 characters, with the `-` character allowed anywhere except the first or last\ncharacter.\n\nThis name needs to be unique across all backup configurations in the same namespace.\n",
    "spec.baseBackups.cronSchedule": "Continuous Archiving backups are composed of periodic *base backups* and all the WAL segments\nproduced in between those base backups. This parameter specifies at what time and with what\nfrequency to start performing a new base backup.\n\nUse cron syntax (`m h dom mon dow`) for this parameter, i.e., 5 values separated by spaces:\n*  `m`: minute, 0 to 59\n*  `h`: hour, 0 to 23\n*  `dom`: day of month, 1 to 31 (recommended not to set it higher than 28)\n*  `mon`: month, 1 to 12\n*  `dow`: day of week, 0 to 7 (0 and 7 both represent Sunday)\n\nAlso ranges of values (`start-end`), the symbol `*` (meaning `first-last`) or even `*/N`, where `N`\nis a number, meaning \"every `N`, may be used. All times are UTC. It is recommended to avoid 00:00 as\nbase backup time, to avoid overlapping with any other external operations happening at this time.\nIf not provided, full backups will be performed each day at 05:00 UTC\n",
    "spec.baseBackups.retention": "Based on this parameter, an automatic retention policy is defined to delete old base backups.\nThis parameter specifies the number of base backups to keep, in a sliding window.\nConsequently, the time range covered by backups is `periodicity*retention`, where `periodicity` is\nthe separation between backups as specified by the `cronSchedule` property.\n\nDefault is 5.\n",
    "spec.baseBackups.compression": "Select the backup compression algorithm. Possible options are: lz4, lzma, brotli. The default method\nis `lz4`. LZ4 is the fastest method, but compression ratio is the worst. LZMA is way slower, but\nit compresses backups about 6 times better than LZ4. Brotli is a good trade-off between speed and\ncompression ratio, being about 3 times better than LZ4.\n",
