# Release 0.9

## NOTES

Here it comes StackGres 0.9!! :tada: :bottle_with_popping_cork: 

The most prominent new feature in this release is easy access to postgres logs with an easy to use interface (through the we UI). It is backed by a dedicated postgres instance, with his own special CR called `SGDistributedLogs`. But even if that is the main feature of this release there are many other new features, changes and fixes that we are proud to bring to you.

To make this release our entire team did a great job, so we hope you will enjoy it!

## UPGRADE

To upgrade from a previous version you will have to re-install StackGres operator. Hot upgrades will be supported in the upcoming `1.0` version. Remember to backup any `SGCluster` data and StackGres CRs. For more detailed information please refer to [our documentation](https://stackgres.io/doc/latest/03-production-installation/02-installation-via-helm/#upgrade-operator).

To re-install StackGres issue following commands (replace namespace and release name if you used something different):

```
NAMESPACE=stackgres
RELEASE=stackgres-operator
helm uninstall -n "$NAMESPACE" "$RELEASE"
kubectl delete crd \
  customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/sgbackupconfigs.stackgres.io \
  customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/sgbackups.stackgres.io \
